### üìò Project Summary

This project investigates the **impact of clear-cutting and replanting** on **runoff patterns and sedimentation dynamics** within a naturalized mature pine plantation located in a **tropical lowland area of Sri Lanka**. The study provides insights into how forestry practices such as tree felling and replanting influence hydrological and erosion processes.

Data were collected in **three phases**:

1. **Before Felling (BF)**
2. **After Felling (AF)**
3. **After Replanting (AR)**

Key variables included: **Runoff, Rainfall, Litter Thickness, Ground Cover Vegetation Percentage (GCVP), Basal Area**, and **Slope**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to understand rainfall, litter thickness, ground cover, and runoff behavior across different phases.
* **ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance)** was applied to quantify pre- and post-harvesting runoff and assess inter-plot variation.
* **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** was used to identify the major factors influencing runoff variation among plots.

Rainfall was treated as an **uncontrollable covariate**, and transformations (logarithmic) were applied to satisfy model assumptions.

### üîç Future Directions

Since the dataset was **collected on a rainy-event basis**, future research should:

* Explore **correlations between successive rainfall events** to understand **temporal dependencies** in runoff generation.
* Model **event-to-event relationships** between rainfall intensity, duration, and resulting runoff.
* Incorporate **sedimentation data** once available, enabling **multivariate analysis (e.g., MANOVA)** to jointly study runoff and sedimentation behavior.
* Extend data collection over a **longer post-replanting period** to evaluate recovery trends in hydrological balance.

### üíª Tools and Packages

Analysis was conducted using **R software**, with packages such as:
`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `lmtest`, and `stats`.
